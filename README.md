### a thousand ways to draw a thing
![Yannick Assogba](owls.png?raw=true "Yannick Assogba")

â€œa thousand ways to draw a thing" uses Google's "quickdraw!" experiment to create interesting representations of a word. quickdraw! is a game in which users are given a word to draw well enough where Google's AI can recognize the drawing in under 20 seconds. What has resulted are over 100,000 different sketches for each word. Assogba uses a method known as Principle Component Analysis to sort the drawings in a way which puts them next to drawings which look similar. What is created is a spectrum of groups of slightly different interpretations of the same word. I had a lot of fun playing with quickdraw!. What was the most fun was seeing how other people interpreted the word. Sometimes every drawing would look the same, like rake or bread, and other times they would be really different, like water slide.

### Small Arms and Ammunitions - Imports and Exports

Another Google production, Small Arms and Ammunitions visualizes the government-sanctioned sales of arms and ammunitions between 1992 and 2010. It shows the Earth with glowing lines connecting all countries who have participated in these known small arms sales and purchases. The thicker and brighter the line, the more valuable the countries imports or exports to the country the line goes to. Imports are in blue, and exports are in orange. The site also breaks down other factors such as ammunition vs civilian weapons vs military and a country's total imports and exports in dollars. I found this fascinating because it showed which countries are the most involved in this market, and with whom they are most involved with. This is a very serious topic, and I think this graphic does a good job respecting that fact.

### Visualizing Toxicity in Twitter Conversations

Peter Beshai was commissioned by Twitter to visualize their new attempts to classify replies to tweets as toxic or not. What resulted was a short video and images which show the progression of responses from an individual tweet taking the form of a growing tree, with more toxic responses in orange and less toxic ones in green. His short video shows some examples of tweets and replies and their correlating tree. One begins with a tweet from a Parkland survivor saying it's ok to feel sad, and shows the growth from this into mostly positive but also negative responses. Another begins with a tweet by Mike Huckabee calling a picture of supposed MS-13 gang members Nancy Pelosi staffers. This tree starts off orange and balloons with hundreds if not thousands of mostly orange replies, but not many branches off these replies. This piece attracted me because I am on Twitter way too much and so I inevitably run into these tweets which cause thousands of negative responses, whether justified or not. Beshai's success in visualizing in one image what would take hours to scroll through gives me a sense of both the content of what I would be seeing and the emotions I would probably leave the post feeling.
